// Exercise 1: Calculate the Sum of Two Numbers

Add the 1st number to the 2nd number to get the outcome of the combined numbers. (SUM)

X + Y = Z

// Exercise 2: Check if a Number is Even or Odd

Check to see if the number is divisible by 2. If so, it is an even number. If not, It is an odd number.

X / 2 = Integer (even)

X / 2 != Integer (odd)

// Exercise 3: 
Write pseudo code that will perform the following.    

a) Read in 5 separate numbers.   
b) Calculate the average of the five numbers.
c) Find the smallest (minimum) and largest (maximum) of the five entered numbers.
d) Write out the results found from steps b and c with a message describing what they are

(Your pseudocode here)
A.
 N1, N2, N3, N4, N5
B.
(N1 + N2 + N3 +N4 + N5)/5 = AVG
C.
Iterate through the numbers, comparing each number to the previous number for the larger number until it reaches the last number. Then give the smallest value and the largest value.
N1 < N2 < N3 < N4 < N5
Smallest: N1 
Largest: N5
D.
Step B:
AVG 
 - the result of adding a group of numbers together and dividing by the amount of numbers in that group
Step C:
Smallest and largest value can be found by comparison of other numbers in the sequence if they are put in order of numerical value from greatest to smallest
